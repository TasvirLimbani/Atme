Make sure to turn the face of your card up to let it allow to move it into the column.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Before turning card face up, check if it has been turned into the bottom card available in the column. This helps you to move all the cards (that have below the face down) can be moved into the unique column. Make sure to turn up the card beneath it every time when you attempt to move a face up card.
